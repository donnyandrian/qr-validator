# QR Scanner Validator

## How to use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/donnyandrian/qr-validator.git`.
2. Clone all the needed Google Drive files:
    - Open `.\helpers\gatherDriveFile.ts`.
    - In the `main` function, update `data` with the content from the spreadsheet's `FOR_DEV_ONLY` sheet, the second content of the last column.
    - Save the file and run the script: `bun run .\helpers\gatherDriveFile.ts`.
3. Install dependencies: `bun install`.
4. Start the server: `bun run dev`.
    - You can forward the port using "VS Code Port Forwarding" or another method to access the app from anywhere, not just localhost.
5. Open the app in your browser: `http://localhost:3000`.
6. Authenticate with a registered token.
    - Before generating tokens, set the encryption key in the `.env` file. For example:
      ```env
      # IMPORTANT: This key MUST be 32 characters (256 bits) long.
      # You can generate a new one using: openssl rand -base64 32
      # Replace `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` with your actual key.
      ENCRYPTION_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      USERDATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY=PLEASE_ASK_THE_ADMIN_TO_GENERATE_THIS
      ```
    - Add the user's data with the authorization level to `usersToEncrypt` in `.\helpers\encrypt-user.ts`.
    - To generate the authentication tokens, run: `bun run .\helpers\encrypt-user.ts`.
    - Copy the tokens from the console output to the `authorized-users.json` file.
    - If the `authorized-users.json` file doesn't exist, create it in the root directory. For example:
      ```json
      [
        "d8a7......",
        "e1b9......",
        "f5c3......"
      ]
      ```
7. Use the **Scanner** tab to scan and validate a QR code.
    - The app will scan continuously. To stop, press the "Stop Scanner" button or refresh the page.
    - The scanner will pause during validation and resume once complete.
    - Validated QR codes are added to the history and will not be scanned again.
    - If you make a mistake, simply delete the entry from the history and scan again.
8. Use the **History** tab to view the validation history.
    - All history entries are stored and persisted in the `history.json` file in the root directory.
9. If you need CSV version of the history, run `bun run .\helpers\jsontocsv.ts`.
10. if you need to quickly compare the history with a list from another source (e.g., a spreadsheet), run `bun run .\helpers\compare.ts`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must adjust the `EVENT` data and validation rules before using the app.
> - For the validation rules, edit the `./src/schemas/validations/${EVENT_NAME}.ts` file.
> - For the data, edit the `client.tsx`, `server.ts`, `type.ts`, and `db.csv` files in `./src/data/${EVENT_NAME}`.

> [!TIP]
> You can duplicate the browser tab (e.g., one for scanning and one for history), and it will work as expected. Refresh the page if needed.
